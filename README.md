# Waymate

Waymate is a student project organized as a monorepo.

The repository uses **Bun workspaces** together with **Turborepo** to manage multiple applications and shared packages in a single codebase. This setup provides a clean project structure and allows development, build, and type-check tasks to be run consistently from the repository root.

## Overview

This repository is currently prepared as the technical foundation for the project.  
The monorepo structure has already been initialized and verified.

The actual implementation of the frontend, backend, database layer, and shared UI library will be added incrementally as project functionality is developed.

## Tech Stack

- **Bun** — package manager and runtime
- **Turborepo** — monorepo task orchestration
- **TypeScript** — shared language across the codebase

Current / planned application stack:

- **React** — frontend
- **Vite** — frontend tooling and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** — frontend styling
- **Elysia** — backend API
- **Drizzle ORM** — database access layer
- **Custom UI component library** — shared UI components in a separate repository `waymate-ui`
